⚡ Textationships (Neo-Brutalist Edition)
"Go make your card. The real conversation comes after."

An entrepreneurial take on the viral textationships tool, redesigned with a Neo-Brutalist aesthetic. This project replaces boring, surface-level knowledge with a systems-thinking approach to social introductions.

🛠 Tech Stack
HTML5/CSS3: Custom layout using a high-contrast, hard-shadow aesthetic.

Vanilla JavaScript: State management for the 9-step wizard and dynamic card generation.

Google Fonts: Space Mono for that technical, academic-yet-youthful intensity.

🚀 Features
9-Step Interactive Wizard: Logical flow from basic identity to social "vibe checks."

Constraint Logic: Hard-coded selection limits (e.g., "Pick 2") to ensure the generated card remains concise and high-signal.

Screenshot-Ready Output: Generates a clean, structured "Spec Sheet" card designed for social sharing.

Mobile First: Fully responsive for the late-night scrolling demographic.
